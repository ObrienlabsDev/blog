## CUDA
Disclaimer: I am new to CUDA, I last worked with GPUs under DirectX 5.0 in 1999.

### CUDA on GCP
### CUDA on Prem
Get yourself a good machine for local development before offloading to GCP for compute tasks.
An example from 2015 is an Intel i7-5820 6 core Haswell and an NVIDIA GTX970 or newer 2070.
My current machine build is based on the Intel i9-13900K 8/16 core and an NVIDIA GTX4090 MSI Liquid-X - see the [Appendix A: Build your local HPC](#)
