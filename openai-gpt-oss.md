>>> describe the relativistic effects that result in gold appearing yellowish
```
Thinking...
User: "describe the relativistic effects that result in gold appearing yellowish". They want a description of relativistic effects causing gold to appear yellowish. 
Gold's color is due to relativistic contraction of electron orbitals of heavy atoms causing shifts in interband transitions. So we should explain that gold's valence 
electrons experience strong spin–orbit coupling, relativity affects d- to s-band transitions shifting absorption in the blue region, making gold appear yellow. Also, 
relativistic effects like mass increase and contraction of inner s-orbitals, stabilization leads to lower-lying d-bands. Combined, they shift optical properties. Provide 
explanation: relativistic quantum mechanics, Dirac equation, scalar relativistic corrections, spin-orbit coupling, contraction, and mention relativity's effect on 
electronic structure which modifies d-band energies, leading to selective absorption of blue/green light, leaving yellow. Provide historical context: discovered in 20th 
century; mention early explanation by P. D. Dr. etc. Might also illustrate with equations: energy shift ~ (Zα)^2. Show effect: high Z like gold (Z=79). Provide simple 
explanation with mention of the Fermi-Dirac distribution? No need. Provide references.

Also mention that in classical optics, gold appears yellow because of visible reflection; but color perception emerges from electronic structure. Provide more details: 
Gold's 5d 6s electron configuration, relativistic stabilization of 6s orbitals lowers energies relative to d orbitals, causing a transition that absorbs blue light; 
relativistic effects are essential for this. The relativistic shift is about 0.5 eV.

Therefore answer: talk about relativistic contraction of s orbitals, expansion of d orbitals, spin–orbit splitting shift in band structure; also mention how this 
explains why other heavy metals like copper (less relativistic) appear reddish. Provide also mention of "d band width" and "Löwdin's effective mass".

We'll produce a comprehensive answer: introduction, physical background, relativistic quantum (Dirac), effect on orbital energies, consequences, demonstration of shift, 
result color, referencing "gold appears yellow because it reflects yellow, unlike other metals due to relativistic interband transitions". Provide diagrams maybe? But 
textual.

Also mention that relativistic effects are not limited to color; used to explain density, melting, conductivity, chemistry.

Alright. Let's craft final.
...done thinking.

## Why Gold Looks Yellow (and Why It Isn’t Pure “Metallic” White)

Gold is a heavy element (atomic number **Z = 79**). In ordinary metals like aluminium or copper the valence electrons behave almost perfectly “Newtonianly”, and the 
optical response is dominated by free‑electron (Drude) absorption in the ultraviolet, leaving the visible part of the spectrum nearly perfectly reflected.  
Gold, however, displays a striking yellow‑to‑red hue that cannot be explained by classical Drude theory alone.  The origin lies in the **relativistic quantum mechanics** 
of gold’s 6‑s and 5‑d valence electrons: relativistic contraction of the inner 6 s shell and the accompanying expansion (and spin‑orbit splitting) of the 5 d shell shift 
a key electronic transition into the visible, absorbing blue light and leaving the remaining spectrum yellow.  

Below is a step‑by‑step explanation of the relativistic effects, with the physical quantities that change and the consequences for the optical spectrum.

---

### 1. Basic Electronic Structure of Gold

| Orbital | Occupancy in Gold (79) | Energy (in eV, non‑relativistic) | Key Transition |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| 5s      | 2                      | –29                              | – |
| 5p      | 6                      | –16                              | – |
| **5d**     | **10**                       | –5                               | **5d → 6s (visible)** |
| 6s      | 1                      | 0 (the Fermi level)              |  |

In the naive (non‑relativistic) picture the 5d band is only a few eV wide, sitting slightly below the 6s band. Transitions from 5d to 6s would therefore fall in the 
near‑infrared (≈1 eV).  Such transitions would not be strong enough to absorb visible light, and gold would look almost metallic white.

---

### 2. Relativistic Corrections in Heavy Atoms

Because the nucleus of gold has a high charge, the 6s electron moves very close to the nucleus and reaches speeds close to the speed of light. Two relativistic effects 
dominate:

| Relativistic Effect | Origin | How It Acts on Orbitals | Quantitative Change |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Scalar (mass‑velocity)** | Increase in electron mass with speed | Contractions of orbitals that have a significant probability density at small \( r \) (the 6s) | ↓ 
Orbital radius by ≈ 20 % |
| **Darwin shift** | Zitterbewegung; smearing of the electron’s position | Further contraction of s orbitals | ↓ Energy of 6s by ≈ 1 eV |
| **Spin–orbit splitting** | Interaction between electron spin and its orbital magnetic field | Splits 5d into \( d_{3/2} \) and \( d_{5/2} \) manifolds; expands the 
d‑band | ↑ Bandwidth by ≈ 0.5 eV, ΔE≈0.4 eV |

Collectively these effects lower the 6s level **relative** to the 5d level by **~1.5–2 eV**.  In other words, the 5d → 6s interband transition that used to lie > 1 eV 
into the infrared is now pushed into the ~2–3 eV range—exactly the energy of blue/violet photons.

The relativistic energy shift can be approximated by

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rel}} \approx \frac{(Z\alpha)^2}{n^2}\,E_{\text{atom}},
\]

where \( \alpha\approx 1/137 \) is the fine‑structure constant, \( Z=79 \) for gold, \( n \) the principal quantum number, and \( E_{\text{atom}} \) the non‑relativistic 
energy scale (≈ 0.1 eV for a 6s electron).  
Plugging in gives shifts of order **1 eV**, precisely what is needed.

---

### 3. Optical Consequence: Absorption of Blue Light

Because the 5d→6s transition is now in the **visible** (≈ 400 nm, 3 eV):

- **Blue photons** (≈ 400 nm, 3 eV) are absorbed by promoting 5d electrons into the 6s conduction band.
- **Red and yellow photons** (≈ 600–700 nm, 1.8–2.0 eV) are **not** efficiently absorbed.
- The remaining visible photons are reflected (including surface plasmons, which are also affected by the altered dielectric function).

The net effect: **yellow light is reflected, while blue light is absorbed**, giving gold its characteristic golden‑yellow hue.

In contrast, a heavy metal such as **copper** (Z = 29) experiences relativistic shifts of only a few 100 meV, enough to explain its reddish‑brown color but far less 
dramatic than gold’s shift into the visible.

---

### 4. Why Relativistic Quantum Chemistry Is Needed

- **Non‑relativistic DFT**: Gold predicted to be blue‑ish, or only slightly less reflective, fails to reproduce the experiment.
- **Dirac‑Kohn‑Sham** (or scalar–relativistic + spin–orbit coupled) calculations reproduce the experimental optical spectra and yield the correct 5d–6s splitting 
(~2 eV).
- **Quantum chemistry** works show that the **band structure** of gold (including the d‑band width and position) is a direct consequence of relativity.

---

### 5. Visualizing the Effect (Textual Diagram)

```
Energy (eV)              Non‑relativistic          Relativistic
   |                            |                        |
   | 5d band (center ~-5 eV)    |      6s (0 eV)        |      6s (-1.5 eV)
   |                            |                        |
   | <------------------------------------>         <-- 5d → 6s transition
                  (≈5–6 eV shift)                (≈3–4 eV shift into visible)
```

---

### 6. Summary of Key Points

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Which relativistic effect dominates?** | Mass‑velocity contraction (scalar) plus spin–orbit coupling. |
| **How large is the energy shift?** | ~1.5–2 eV for the 5d–6s transition. |
| **What wavelength does gold absorb?** | Blue/ultraviolet (~400–450 nm). |
| **Why other metals look different?** | Their weaker relativistic shift keeps the key transitions out of the visible. |
| **Are there any other optical phenomena tied to relativity?** | Yes—gold’s surface plasmon resonance, its unusual work function, and even its density/ melting point. |

Thus, **relativistic quantum mechanics** reshapes the electronic band structure of gold so that a formerly hidden 5d→6s transition becomes visible, absorbing blue light 
and leaving a yellow‑ish reflection that we recognize as gold.

The constrained view is what makes the geometry pop.

2) Geometric implications
Shape of the constraint set
L1: the set 
{
𝑤
:
∥
𝑤
∥
1
≤
𝑡
}
{w:∥w∥ 
1
​
 ≤t} is a diamond in 2D (a cross‑polytope in higher‑D) with sharp corners on the coordinate axes.

𝑤
∥
2
≤
𝑟
}
{w:∥w∥ 
2
​
 ≤r} is a circle in 2D (a hypersphere in higher‑D), smooth and isotropic.

Where the optimizer lands
Draw loss contours (typically ellipses for squared loss). The solution is where a contour first touches the feasible region.

L1: contours tend to touch at a corner → at least one coordinate is exactly zero → sparse solution (implicit feature selection).

L2: contours touch a smooth point on the sphere → coordinates are all nonzero but shrunken → no selection, just shrinkage.

A quick mental picture (2D):

sql
Copy
L1 (diamond):   ♦     First contact at a corner → zeros
L2 (circle):    ⭘     First contact on smooth edge → shrinkage
Basis dependence vs rotational invariance
L1 is axis‑aligned: rotate the feature space (orthonormal transform) and the diamond rotates with the axes; which coefficients go to zero can change.

L2 is rotationally invariant: a sphere looks the same after any rotation; solutions behave consistently under orthonormal reparameterizations.

Correlated features
L1 often selects one feature from a correlated group and sets the rest to zero (corner‑hitting behavior).

L2 tends to share weight across correlated features (the round constraint does not favor axes).

3) Optimization view (why sparsity happens)
Consider squared loss. The optimality conditions are:

L2 (ridge) adds a smooth quadratic; the proximal step is just uniform shrinkage:

Any coordinate with magnitude below the threshold is snapped to exactly zero—the algorithmic reflection of the diamond’s corners.

L1 ⇔ Laplace prior (double‑exponential): density has a sharp peak at 0 → higher probability that coefficients are exactly zero.

5) Practical differences (quick checklist)
Property	L1 (lasso)	L2 (ridge)
Typical effect	Many coefficients exactly 0 (sparse)	Coefficients all small, rarely zero
Stability with collinearity	Can be unstable (which feature is picked may flip)	More stable; spreads weight

 ) blends both: keeps sparsity while smoothing out lasso’s instability with correlated features.

Bottom line
L1: polyhedral geometry with corners on axes → sparsity and implicit feature selection.

L2: smooth spherical geometry → shrinkage, stability, and rotational invariance.

If you like “how things have always been done,” ridge (L2/Tikhonov) gives classical, stable shrinkage. If you need a forward‑leaning, compact model in high dimensions, lasso (L1) uses geometry to zero out dead weight.

>>> describe the difference between L1 and L2 regularization - what are the geometric implications
Thinking...
The user asks to describe the difference between L1 and L2 regularization, and what the geometric implications are. They want an explanation. We should explain that L1 
encourages sparsity, L2 encourages small coefficients. Show geometric shapes of penalty surfaces: L1 is diamond (octahedron) which intersects the hyperplane more often 
leading to sparse solutions. L2 is sphere (ball) which intersects at many directions. Discuss effect on solution path, bias-variance tradeoff, variable selection, etc. 
Also mention geometry of constraint vs regularization. Perhaps illustrate by Lasso and Ridge. Provide some math: minimize least squares + lambda*||w||1 or ||w||2. 
Explain that the level sets of L1 have corners that align with axes. Provide intuition: L1 can set many coefficients exactly to zero. L2 leads to shrinkage but rarely 
zero. Talk about geometry: L1-ball is a cross-polytope, L2 is Euclidean ball. For 2D, show difference. Provide explanation for geometry: intersection at point where 
gradient direction is in tangent. Provide difference in regularization path: L1 path is piecewise linear; L2 is smooth.

Also mention that L1 can produce better feature selection when number of features > samples. L2 better for collinear features. Talk about geometric difference in the 
context of constrained optimization: L1 uses ℓ1-norm constraint set, L2 uses ℓ2-norm constraint. Provide details about the shape: ℓ1 is convex but has many extreme 
points. ℓ2 is smooth.

Also mention that in classification problems L1 leads to sparse solutions.

We can add some visual description: L1 gives diamond (in 2D) or octahedron (in higher dims), L2 gives circle sphere.

We can mention that L1 penalty creates sharp corners that encourage zeros.

Also mention that L2 can be seen as imposing a Gaussian prior on weights; L1 corresponds to Laplace prior. Provide explanation.

Should also mention difference in regularization path: L1 leads to variables entering sequentially.

So we provide a succinct but thorough answer. We'll include math: objective J(θ)=||y-Xθ||^2 + λ||θ||1 vs λ||θ||2^2. Provide description.

We'll describe geometry of unconstrained vs constrained. For constrained optimization: minimize 1/2||y-Xθ||^2 subject to ||θ||p ≤ t. The penalty surfaces: L1: cross 
polytope, L2: sphere/band. The intersection with level sets of loss leads to different solution. Provide explanation.

Let's answer.
...done thinking.

## L1 vs. L2 Regularization  
(The “why” and the “what it looks like” in a single bite.)

| Feature | L1 (‖w‖₁) | L2 (‖w‖₂²) |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Penalty** | \( \lambda \sum_{j}|w_{j}|\) | \(\lambda \sum_{j} w_{j}^{2}\) |
| **Prior / Bayesian view** | Laplace / double‑exponential (heavy‑tailed) | Gaussian (light‑tailed) |
| **Effect on coefficients** | Drives many \(w_{j}=0\) (sparse) | Shrinks all \(w_{j}\) but rarely to zero |
| **Geometric shape (constraint set)** | Cross‑polytope (diamond in 2‑D, octahedron in > 2‑D) | Euclidean ball (circle in 2‑D, sphere in > 2‑D) |
| **Typical behaviour in high‑dimensional data** | Variable selection (“Lasso”) | Ridge shrinkage → handles multicollinearity |

---

### 1.  The algebraic form

In least–squares regression we minimize  

\[
J_{\text{LS}}(w)=\tfrac12\|y-Xw\|_{2}^{2} .
\]

Regularization just adds a penalty term:

| L1 | L2 |
|---|---|
| \(J_{\text{L1}}(w)=\tfrac12\|y-Xw\|_{2}^{2}+ \lambda\|w\|_{1}\) | \(J_{\text{L2}}(w)=\tfrac12\|y-Xw\|_{2}^{2}+ \lambda\|w\|_{2}^{2}\) |

**Constraint‑form version** (useful for geometric intuition):

\[
\min_{w}\tfrac12\|y-Xw\|_{2}^{2} \quad\text{s.t.}\quad \|w\|_{p}\le t .
\]

Take \(p=1\) for Lasso, \(p=2\) for ridge.

---

### 2.  What the penalty set looks like

#### 2‑D illustration

```
   L1  |  L2
   (diamond) |  (circle)
      /\          /\
     /  \        /  \
    /    \      /    \
   -------------------------
```

- **L1**: the unit‑ball is a diamond whose *corners* lie on the coordinate axes.  
- **L2**: the unit‑ball is a smooth circle.

In higher dimensions the shapes become the cross‑polytope (octahedron) and the ball, respectively.

#### Geometry of a regularized solution

The loss surface \(\|y-Xw\|^{2}\) is a set of ellipsoids (paraboloids).  
The regularization penalty is a “rubber‑band” that keeps the solution within a surface:

- **Ridge (L2)**: the rubber‑band is a smooth sphere – it tends to intersect the loss surface at a *smooth* point, pulling the solution towards the origin uniformly 
along all directions.
- **Lasso (L1)**: the rubber‑band is a sharp diamond – as the loss ellipsoid expands outward, its first point of contact is usually at a *corner* of the diamond.  
  If that corner is on an axis, the corresponding coefficient becomes exactly zero.

---

### 3.  Why corners induce sparsity

1. **Corner effect**  
   - The L1‑ball has many *extreme points* (the axes).  
   - The gradient of the loss often points towards one of those axes – the solution is “stuck” there and the coefficient is set to zero.

2. **Piecewise‑linear solution path**  
   - As \(\lambda\) decreases, the L1 solution changes linearly in segments (variables enter or leave the active set one at a time).  
   - This “sparsity‑driven” path is algorithmically exploitable (least‑angle regression – LARS).

3. **Probabilistic interpretation**  
   - Laplace prior → posterior mode coincides with zero probability for many coefficients.  
   - Gaussian prior → continuous shrinkage.

4. **Effect on bias‑variance**  
   - L1: high bias on many coefficients (they’re zero) but lower variance when the true coefficients are indeed sparse.  
   - L2: lower bias (all coefficients are retained) but can lead to higher variance if many are nearly irrelevant.

---

### 4.  Practical take‑aways

| When to prefer | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| **Large *p*, small *n*** (high‑dimensional, sparse true signal) | L1 gives feature selection – you get interpretable models. |
| **Strong multicollinearity** (predictors highly correlated) | L2 distributes weight among correlated variables, giving stable estimates. |
| **Need for regularized prediction but not interpretability** | L2 keeps all variables, often achieving smaller test MSE in presence of many weak signals. |
| **Computational speed** | L2 solutions are analytic (closed form), L1 requires iterative solvers (but efficient algorithms exist, e.g., coordinate descent). |

---

### 5.  A quick visual demo (2‑D)

Consider minimizing \( (w_{1}-1)^{2}+(w_{2}-1)^{2}\).

- **L2 penalty (∥w∥₂² ≤ t)** → solution is a point inside a circle.  
  The intersection with the paraboloid is smooth, giving a *rounded* result.

- **L1 penalty (∥w∥₁ ≤ t)** → the constraint is a diamond.  
  The intersection often lands on the diamond’s corner, say at \((w_{1}=1,\,w_{2}=0)\) or \((0,1)\) – one coefficient becomes exactly 0.

This basic picture scales: in any dimension, the L1 ball has corners aligned with the axes, so the optimizer can “bite” through a subset of variables, giving sparsity.

---

## Bottom line

| Property | L1 | L2 |
|----------|----|----|
| Penalty shape | Sharp corners (cross‑polytope) | Smooth ball |
| Coefficient outcome | Many zeros → sparse model | Small but non‑zero everywhere |
| Computational note | Requires iterative solvers (coordinate descent, LARS) | Closed form or very fast (ridge) |
| Ideal use | Feature selection, high‑dimensional sparse problems | Prediction when many variables contribute modestly, or when variables are collinear |

Geometrically, *the difference is the “shape” of the rubber band that pulls the solution toward the origin.*  
The “corned diamond” of L1 drags the solution toward axes, killing features; the “smooth circle” of L2 drags evenly, just shrinking them.

Thinking...
We need to respond describing difference between L1 and L2 regularization, and geometric implications. Should explain penalty terms, sparsity, convex shape, contour 
geometry, effect on solution: L1 leads to axis-aligned diamond (L1 norm ball), which tends to intersect with elliptical contours at corners leading to sparse solutions; 
L2 is spherical (circle) leading to shrinkage but not sparsity. Include geometrical view of loss surfaces, regularization path, effect on coefficient magnitude, etc. 
Provide also explanation of effect on bias-variance tradeoff. Might also discuss elastic net. Provide figures description since can't show actual images. Use math

## 1.  What the two penalties look like (the formulas)

| Regularizer | Formula (for a weight vector \(w\in\mathbb{R}^p\)) | Typical objective |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **\(L_1\) (lasso)** | \(\displaystyle \|w\|_{1}= \sum_{j=1}^{p}|w_j|\) | \(\displaystyle \min_{w}\; \mathcal L(w) + \lambda \|w\|_{1}\) |
| **\(L_2\) (ridge)** | \(\displaystyle \|w\|_{2}^{2}= \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^{2}\) | \(\displaystyle \min_{w}\; \mathcal L(w) + \lambda \|w\|_{2}^{2}\) |

where  

* \(\mathcal L(w)\) is the data‑fitting loss (e.g. squared error for linear regression, negative log‑likelihood for logistic regression).  
* \(\lambda\ge 0\) controls the strength of regularisation.

Both are **convex** and **additive** across dimensions, but they behave very differently because the *shape* of their level sets is different. That geometric difference 
is what drives the distinct statistical properties.

---

## 2.  Geometric picture in two dimensions  

### 2.1.  Contours of the loss \(\mathcal L(w)\)

If we ignore the regulariser for a second, the loss surface \(\mathcal L(w)\) (e.g. the sum‑of‑squared residuals) is typically an **elliptical bowl** centered at the 
ordinary‑least‑squares (OLS) solution \(w_{\text{OLS}}\).  
For a quadratic loss the contours are exact ellipses:

\[
\{w \mid \mathcal L(w) = c\} = \{w \mid (w-w_{\text{OLS}})^\top \Sigma^{-1} (w-w_{\text{OLS}}) = c\},
\]

where \(\Sigma\) is the covariance of the design matrix.

### 2.2.  The regulariser’s “ball”

* **\(L_2\) ball** – the set \(\{w\mid \|w\|_2 \leq r\}\) is a **circle** (in 2‑D) or a sphere (in higher D).  
* **\(L_1\) ball** – the set \(\{w\mid \|w\|_1 \leq r\}\) is a **diamond** (2‑D) or a **cross‑polytope** (higher D). Its corners lie on the coordinate axes.

### 2.3.  The constrained view  

Minimising the penalised objective is equivalent (by Lagrange duality) to solving:

\[
\min_{w}\; \mathcal L(w) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad \|w\|_{1}\leq t \quad\text{or}\quad \|w\|_{2}\leq t .
\]

Geometrically we **slide** the loss ellipse towards the origin until it first touches the feasible set (the ball). The point of first contact is the solution.

| Regulariser | Typical contact point | What this means |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **Ridge (L2)** | Touches the **smooth** circular boundary at a point **away from the axes**. | All coefficients are shrunk proportionally; none are forced to be 
exactly zero. |
| **Lasso (L1)** | Diamond has **sharp corners** on the axes. The ellipse often hits a corner, making one or more coordinates **exactly zero**. | Produces *sparse* 
solutions—automatic variable selection. |

> **Intuition** – Imagine a rubber band (the loss ellipse) being pulled toward the origin. A circular rubber band can slide around smoothly, whereas a diamond‑shaped 
band has “pinch points” that snag the rubber band. When the rubber band gets caught at a pinch point, one coordinate collapses to zero.

---

## 3.  High‑dimensional geometry

| Dimension | Shape of the \(L_2\) ball | Shape of the \(L_1\) ball |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2         | Circle (radius \(r\)) | Diamond (vertices on axes) |
| 3         | Sphere (surface of a ball) | Octahedron (8 triangular faces, vertices on axes) |
| \(p\)     | Euclidean sphere \(S_{2}^{p-1}\) | **Cross‑polytope** \(C_{1}^{p}\) (the convex hull of the \(2p\) points \(\pm r e_j\)) |

*The cross‑polytope has a huge fraction of its surface concentrated near the axes.*  
In very high dimensions the \(L_1\) ball is “spikier”: most of its volume lives in the corners where many coefficients are small or zero. The \(L_2\) ball, by contrast, 
is isotropic – every direction looks the same.

This concentration explains why in large‑\(p\) settings the lasso tends to set many coefficients exactly to zero, whereas ridge merely pulls them toward the origin.

### 3.1.  Subgradients and optimality

* **Ridge:** The gradient of \(\|w\|_{2}^{2}\) is \(2w\). The optimality condition is smooth:

  \[
  \nabla\mathcal L(w^\star) + 2\lambda w^\star = 0.
  \]

* **Lasso:** \(\|w\|_{1}\) is **nondifferentiable** at zero. Its subgradient is  

  \[
  \partial |w_j| = \begin{cases}
  \operatorname{sign}(w_j) & w_j\neq0\\[4pt]
  [-1,\,1] & w_j = 0 .
  \end{cases}
  \]

  The KKT condition becomes

  \[
  \nabla\mathcal L(w^\star)_j + \lambda\,\gamma_j = 0,\qquad \gamma_j\in\partial|w_j|.
  \]

  If \(|\nabla\mathcal L(w^\star)_j| < \lambda\) the only way to satisfy the condition is to set \(w_j^\star=0\). That is the **soft‑thresholding** rule that underlies 
the sparsity property.

## 4.  Consequences for the estimated coefficients

| Property | Ridge (\(L_2\)) | Lasso (\(L_1\)) |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Shrinkage** | All coefficients are multiplied by a factor < 1 (biased towards 0). | Small coefficients are **soft‑thresholded**: they may be set exactly to 0, larger 
ones are reduced by \(\lambda\). |
| **Bias‑variance trade‑off** | Reduces variance by pulling coefficients toward a common centre (the origin). | Reduces variance *and* performs variable selection, often 
yielding larger bias for the retained variables. |
| **Prediction vs. interpretation** | Good for improving prediction when many correlated predictors exist. | Useful when we want a parsimonious model (feature 
selection). |
| **Handling of collinearity** | Distributes the weight among correlated predictors (they share the shrinkage). | Tends to pick *one* predictor from a correlated group 
and zero‑out the rest (the “grouping effect” is weaker). |
| **Solution path** | Gives a smooth, continuous ridge trace as \(\lambda\) varies. | Piecewise‑linear path; coefficients enter/leave the model at distinct \(\lambda\) 
values. |

---

## 5.  Visualising the paths (1‑D example)

For a single coefficient \(w\) with a quadratic loss \(\tfrac12 (w - \hat w)^2\):

* **Ridge:**  
  \[
  \min_w \frac12 (w-\hat w)^2 + \lambda w^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad w^\star = \frac{\hat w}{1+2\lambda}.
  \]
  The solution shrinks continuously toward zero as \(\lambda\) grows.

* **Lasso:**  
  \[
  \min_w \frac12 (w-\hat w)^2 + \lambda |w|
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  w^\star = \operatorname{sign}(\hat w)\,\bigl(|\hat w|-\lambda\bigr)_+ .
  \]
  This is the **soft‑thresholding** operator. When \(|\hat w| \le \lambda\) the estimate becomes exactly zero.

The graph of the ridge solution is a hyperbola; the lasso solution looks like a V‑shaped line that flattens at zero.

---

## 6.  Geometric intuition for the **bias‑variance** trade‑off

*Take the loss contours as probability clouds:*  
The data‑likelihood (or OLS loss) defines an ellipsoidal confidence region around the *true* parameter vector. Adding a regulariser shrinks the feasible region:

- **Ridge**: The spherical \(L_2\) ball cuts off the tails of the ellipsoid **uniformly** in all directions. The result is a *biased* estimator (the centre moves towards 
the origin) but the *spread* (variance) is reduced in *every* direction.

- **Lasso**: The diamond (or cross‑polytope) cuts off the ellipsoid **asymmetrically**—it aggressively truncates the axes. Directions aligned with the axes get a 
**hard** cut (coefficient forced to zero), whereas directions that lie off the axes are only mildly trimmed. The variance reduction is therefore larger for the 
coefficients that are eliminated, at the cost of a larger bias for the remaining ones.

---

## 7.  When to prefer which regulariser? (Geometric “rule of thumb”)

| Situation (geometric viewpoint) | Recommended regulariser |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Many correlated predictors** – the loss ellipsoid is elongated along a subspace spanned by those predictors. | **Ridge** (the \(L_2\) ball will intersect the 
ellipsoid along that whole subspace, sharing weight). |
| **Sparse true model** – the true parameter lies near a coordinate axis (most entries truly zero). | **Lasso** (the \(L_1\) diamond will likely touch at a corner, 
reproducing sparsity). |
| **Need a compromise** – you want both shrinkage and some sparsity. | **Elastic net** (\(\alpha\|w\|_1 + (1-\alpha)\|w\|_2^2\)) – the feasible set is a *rounded 
diamond* that keeps the grouping property of ridge while allowing corner hits. |
| **Very high‑dimensional, \(p\gg n\)** – the geometry of the \(L_1\) ball in huge dimensions makes it easier to “carve out” a low‑dimensional face (i.e., a sparse 
solution). | **Lasso** (or variants such as the **group lasso**, **sorted‑\(L_1\)** etc.). |

---

## 8.  Summary diagram (described in words)

Imagine three concentric shapes centred at the origin:

1. A **circle** (L2 ball).  
2. A **diamond** (L1 ball).  
3. A **rounded diamond** (elastic‑net ball).

Superimpose on them a set of **elliptical loss contours** centered at the OLS solution.  

- As the penalty strength \(\lambda\) increases, the feasible shape shrinks.  
- The **first point of tangency** is the regularised solution.  

For the circle, tangency typically occurs on a smooth part of the contour → *all coordinates non‑zero*.  
For the diamond, tangency often occurs at a vertex → *some coordinates exactly zero*.  
For the rounded diamond, you can get a mix: vertices are softened, allowing a few zeros while preserving some ridge‑type grouping.

---

## 9.  Take‑away bullet points

* **\(L_2\) regularisation = shrinking**  
  *Geometric view*: intersect ellipsoidal loss with a **sphere** → solution stays inside, never lands on an axis.  
  *Statistical effect*: all coefficients are reduced proportionally; no automatic variable selection.

* **\(L_1\) regularisation = sparsifying**  
  *Geometric view*: intersect ellipsoidal loss with a **diamond/cross‑polytope** → solution often hits a corner → some coefficients become exactly zero.  
  *Statistical effect*: built‑in feature selection; stronger bias for retained coefficients but large variance reduction for the zeroed ones.

* The **shape** of the constraint set determines *where* the loss contour can first touch it, and hence which coefficients survive.

* In high‑dimensional spaces the **\(L_1\) ball’s corners dominate its surface**, making sparsity a natural outcome; the **\(L_2\) ball remains isotropic**, favouring 
uniform shrinkage.

* **Elastic‑net** blends the two geometries, producing a *rounded diamond* that keeps the grouping behaviour of ridge while still allowing sparsity.
